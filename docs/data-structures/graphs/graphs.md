# GRAPHS

vertices= nodes
edges= undirected/directed connetion between nodes (vertices)

## UNDIRECTED GRAPHS
### Operation

- Adding a vertex
Time Complexity: O(1)

- Adding an edge
Time Complexity: O(1)

- Removing a vertex
Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

- Removing an edge
Time Complexity: O(E)

## WEIGHTED GRAPHS

## UNWEIGHTED GRAPHS
### Operation


# Calculating diameter/ radius in a graph
## DIAMETER
*The maximum of all maximum distances betwen a vertex (node) to all vertices (nodes) is the diameter of a graph*

## RADIUS
*The minimum of all maximum distances betwen a vertex (node) to all vertices (nodes) is the radius of a graph*

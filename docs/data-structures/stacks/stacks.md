# STACKS 
- Represent a dynamic set of data
- Like queues, the delete operation is done in a predefined manner (Last-in, First-out)
- Great for backtracking (e.g. finding a path through a maze)
- Commonly used in compile-time memory management
- Commonly applied to DFS

## Operations
### POP "Delete"
- Pop operation takes no arguments
- Elements are removed from the "start" of the stack

Time complexity:
- Average Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(1)

### PUSH "insert"
- Elements are inserted starting at the "end" of the stack

Time complexity:
- Average Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(1)

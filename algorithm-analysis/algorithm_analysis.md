# Algorithm analysis

## Problems, Algorithms and Programs


### Problems
* A problem maps inputs to outputs.
* A problem is a mapping from inputs to outputs, and there might be many algorithms that can accomplish this mapping.


### Programs
* A program is an instantiation of an algorithm implemented in a specific programming language.


### Algorithms
* An algorithm is a series of steps that act as a recipe to solve a particular problem.

## Graph
### What is it?
A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.
### What does it do?
Represents relationships or connections between entities.
### Usage
- **Social Networks**: Representing friendships where each person is a node and an edge represents a friendship.
- **Maps**: Representing cities (nodes) and roads (edges) connecting them.

## Map
### What is it?
A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
### What does it do?
Allows for fast retrieval, insertion, and deletion of values based on keys.
### Usage
- **Phone Book**: Names as keys and phone numbers as values.
- **Dictionary**: Words as keys and definitions as values.

## Priority Queue
### What is it?
A data structure where each element has a priority and the element with the highest priority is served first.
### What does it do?
Manages a set of records with dynamically changing priorities.
### Usage
- **Task Scheduling**: Operating systems managing processes where some tasks have higher priority.
- **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: Finding the shortest path in a graph where the next node to explore is the one with the smallest tentative distance.
## Queue
### What is it?
A collection of elements that supports adding elements to the rear and removing elements from the front (FIFO: First-In-First-Out).
### What does it do?
Manages ordered sequences of items.
### Usage
- **Customer Service**: Customers lining up in the order they arrive.
- **Print Queue**: Print jobs processed in the order they are received.

## Set
### What is it?
A collection of unique elements.
### What does it do?
Supports operations like union, intersection, and difference.
### Usage
- **Unique Items**: Tracking unique visitors to a website.
- **Tagging**: Managing tags where each tag is unique.

## Stack
### What is it?
A collection of elements that supports adding and removing elements from the top (LIFO: Last-In-First-Out).
### What does it do?
Manages elements in a reverse order.
### Usage
- **Undo Mechanism**: In text editors where the last operation is undone first.
- **Function Call Management**: Call stack in programming where the last called function is executed first.
